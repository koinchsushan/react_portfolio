**GitHub Repository:** *https://github.com/koinchsushan/react_portfolio*

## 🧑‍💻 About the Project

This is my professional portfolio built as a single-page application (SPA) using React, demonstrating my proficiency in modern front-end development, complex state management, and advanced web animation techniques.

## 🚀 What I Learned & Implemented

### ⭐ React Fundamentals

* Built using `create-react-app`
* Developed modular and reusable **functional components**
* Utilized JSX and React Hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`
* Implemented component-based UI and props/state for data flow

### 🧩 Component Architecture

* Separated website sections into dedicated components, such as:

  * Navbar
  * Home
  * About
  * Skills
  * Contact
* Maintained clean folder structure (e.g., `src/components/`, `src/data.js`)
* Populated sections dynamically using exported static data arrays

### 🎨 UI & Styling

* Applied modern styling approaches such as:

  * SCSS / CSS modules / custom styling (based on user setup)
* Advanced styling with variables, loops, and modular structure
* Built a navigation system with:

  * Smooth scrolling to sections
  * Sticky or persistent navbar for easy navigation

### 🚀 Advanced Animations & Design

* **GSAP-Powered SVG Animation:** Utilized the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) with `DrawSVGPlugin` to create a dramatic, frame-by-frame drawing animation of the main logo on the homepage.
* **3D Skills Cube:** Designed and implemented a custom-built, continuously spinning **CSS 3D cube** on the About page to showcase core technical skills (React, HTML5, CSS3, JS, Git).
* **Dynamic Text Effects:** Applied letter-by-letter popping animations to titles using custom logic, creating an immediate visual impact upon loading.
* **Enhanced UX:** Integrated a custom Pac-Man loader for visually appealing page transitions.

### 📧 Serverless Interactivity
* **Contact Form with `email.js`:** Developed a fully functional contact form that sends emails directly without requiring a backend server or complex API setup, demonstrating proficiency in third-party service integration.
* **Interactive Mapping:** Embedded a location map using the **React Leaflet** library, featuring a custom marker and popup.

### ⚙ Deployment & Production

* Pushed code to GitHub
* Deployed on a hosting platform such as:

  * Netlify
  * Vercel
  * GitHub Pages
* Created optimized build using `npm run build`

### 🎯 Personal Branding

This portfolio highlights:

* 3 years of professional front-end development experience
* Strong React and Angular background
* Experience working on real-world web applications
* Academic journey:

  * MSc in Data Analytics at London Metropolitan University
